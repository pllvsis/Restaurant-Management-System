# Restaurant-Management-System

This project is a data structure and graphics project created using C language.

It is a simple, user friendly system that can be used by restaurant staff to allot tables to customers and create a waiting list if required. It also allows waiters to take orders via a simple dish number system along with the quantity. It stores orders of each table and on the table vacate command, generates a bill for the particular table while making the table free for seating.

This project was created by me to have a better understanding of Data Structures as a 2nd Year student. It was also used to study the graphics library and create an interface for the same.
